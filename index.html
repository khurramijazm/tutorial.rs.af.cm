        <h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>If you know the basics that Node gives you an option to create an instance of http server. It gives 
you req, and res objects and you can do what ever you like with the request object and use the response object to send any thing back to the connected client. </p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout https://github.com/khurramijazm/tutorial.rs.af.cm.git
</code></pre>

<h3>Serving Static Contents</h3>

<p>you can send the whole static website served through node , what that means is you redirect the 
request to an index.html page on your server and from there onward serve what ever you would like. 
more on this from the code snippets which talk more then the explanation here. </p>

<h3>Rendering Templates On the server and serving html using node.(that is not serving static contents)</h3>

<p>Connecting to mongodb or mysql and creating bits and pieces of the information and compiling a final 
response which gets sent to the client. </p>

<h3>Socket.io</h3>

<p>HTML5 using websockets. What are web sockets what they are useful for ? what we can achieve from them. 
What is the difference between using web sockets and ajax..</p>

<p>I will be putting more information soon. Stay tuned <a href="https://github.com/khurramijazm" class="user-mention">@khurramijazm</a></p>
